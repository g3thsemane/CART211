                        “I was seventeen. Only child, not a lot of friends. But I had a plan. I was going to become an
                        actress, get a role on
                        All My Children, meet my husband on set– and when that was all over, I’d host a talk show. Kelly
                        Ripa did it; I could do
                        it too. Back then it seemed like every woman on television had gotten their start as beauty
                        queen.
                        So my senior year I
                        decided to enter my school’s Homecoming Queen competition. It was organized like a Ms. America
                        pageant. But this was a
                        rough high school, only one other girl signed up, so I had a good shot. My whole family got
                        behind
                        me. My mom was a
                        seamstress. We noticed that in most pageants we watched, the winner wore a white dress. So she
                        sewed
                        me a white dress
                        that I picked out of Seventeen Magazine. First came the interview portion, and that’s when the
                        trouble started. The
                        judges asked me about the Anita Hill testimony; I wasn’t ready for that. I was ready for world
                        peace. They were supposed
                        to ask me about my goals, so I could say world peace. But that didn’t happen. The talent portion
                        was
                        later that night at
                        the homecoming dance. The whole school was there. I chose a Sheena Easton song; poor choice. Not
                        the
                        right crowd for
                        that. The other girl chose ‘I Feel Good’ by Stephanie Mills, and she had the whole crowd singing
                        along. That’s when I
                        knew it was over. But then, a miracle. The guidance counselor quieted everyone down, and
                        announced
                        the winner: it was
                        me. Me! It was my Kelly Kapowski moment. Everyone was cheering, the other girl congratulated me.
                        But
                        it only lasted five
                        seconds, because the guidance counselor said: ‘Wait a second, I’m sorry. Joanna is the
                        runner-up.’
                        It was the worst
                        moment of my life. In fact, the only thing that got me through COVID was knowing that it could
                        not
                        possibly, possibly be
                        worse than that moment. And here’s a twist for you. Remember that guidance counselor? Several
                        years
                        later I ended up
                        acting alongside his son in a play at Queens College. In one scene I pulled a gun on him, and
                        the
                        director was like: ‘We
                        need more anger. Think about something that makes you angry.’ I was like: ‘Well, that’s easy.
                        His
                        father ruined my
                        senior year. And quite possibly, my entire life.”
